    <h2>Shiny Application</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ol>
<li>Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a  user will need to get started using your application.</li>
<li>Deploy the application on Rstudio&#39;s shiny server</li>
<li>Share the application link by pasting it into the text box below</li>
<li>Share your server.R and ui.R code on github</li>
</ol>

<p>The application must include the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)</li>
<li>Some operation on the ui input in sever.R</li>
<li>Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations</li>
<li>You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.</li>
<li>The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Shiny application in question is entirely up to you. However, if you&#39;re having trouble coming up with ideas, you could start from the simple prediction algorithm done in class and build a new algorithm on one of the R datasets packages. Please make the package simple for the end user, so that they don&#39;t need a lot of your prerequisite knowledge to evaluate your application. You should emphasize a simple project given the short time frame.  </p>

    <h2>Evaluation Criteria for Application</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Provide constructive feedback to the student who submitted the work. Point out the strengths of their application, and give them advice about how it could be improved in the future.<br></li>
<li>Was there enough documentation on the shiny site for a user to get started using the application?</li>
<li>Did the application run as described in the documentation?</li>
<li>Was there some form of widget input (slider, textbox, radio buttons, checkbox, ...) in either ui.R or a custom web page?</li>
<li>Did server.R perform some calculations on the input in server.R?</li>
<li>Was the server calculation displayed in the html page?</li>
<li>Was the app substantively different than the very simple applications built in the class? Note, it&#39;s OK if the app is simple and based on the one presented in class, I just don&#39;t want it to be basically a carbon copy of the examples we covered. As an example, if someone simply changed the variable names, then this would not count. However, a prediction algorithm that had a similar layout would be fine.</li>
<li>Here&#39;s your opportunity to give the app +1 for being well done, or neat, or even just a solid effort.</li>
<li>If any of your grading decisions require explanation, please note your explanations here.<br></li>

    <h2>Project Pitch</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>You get 5 slides (inclusive of the title slide)  to pitch a your app. You&#39;re going to create a web page using Slidify or Rstudio Presenter with an html5 slide deck.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what you need</p>

<ol>
<li>5 slides to pitch our idea done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter</li>
<li>Your presentation pushed to github or Rpubs</li>
<li>A link to your github or Rpubs presentation pasted into the text box below</li>
</ol>

<p>Your presentation must satisfy the following</p>

<ol>
<li>It must be done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter</li>
<li>It must be 5 pages</li>
<li>It must be hosted on github or Rpubs</li>
<li>It must contained some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document</li>
</ol>

<p>Notice to publish your slidify presentation to github or Rpubs, there&#39;s the publish command. This link outlines how to do it (it&#39;s one line). </p>

<p><a href="http://slidify.org/publish.html">http://slidify.org/publish.html</a></p>

<p>Rstudio presenter has a button to publish directly to Rpubs <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200714023-Displaying-and-Distributing-Presentations">https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200714023-Displaying-and-Distributing-Presentations</a>. If you are using Rpubs, put in the link to the presentation into the submission box as a http:// link not a https:// link.</p>

<p>You can also publish using both formats to github manually using gh-pages, though your github branch must have a .nojekyll fle and be on a branch names gh-pages. There&#39;s more on gh-pages here <a href="https://pages.github.com/">https://pages.github.com/</a>  and there is a video lecture outlining how to do this.</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Was the presentation completed in slidify or R Presenter?</li>
<li>Was it 5 pages?</li>
<li>Did it contain an R expression that got evaluated and displayed?</li>
<li>Was it hosted on github or Rpubs?</li>
<li>Was the presentation actually a presentation? (I.e. it had a legitimate pitch for the shiny application?)</li>
<li>Here&#39;s your opportunity to give this presentation a +1 for being well done. Did they tinker around with the default style? Was the presentation particularly lucid and well organized? In other words, the student made a legitimate try.</li>
<li>There were no R errors displayed in the presentation.</li>
<li>If any of your grading decisions require explanation, please note your explanations here.</li>
